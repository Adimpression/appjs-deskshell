appjs-deskshell
===============

Experimental project to create a desktop shell for a web application. Support windows, linux and mac 
desktop applications. See http://appjs.delightfulsoftware.com/ for my previous work on packaging appjs for windows and linux.

The application interface will be built in chrome html5 - so html, css etc. "Backend" logic can be written in any
platform that we get support code written for. If you don't see your platform then add it.

Windows:
========

An installer is available for windows: [http://appjs.delightfulsoftware.com/deskshell/deskshell-install.exe].


Mac & Linux:
============

Planned for the near future.
