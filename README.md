deskshell
=========

Deskshell is a SDK that provides a shell (as in egg shell) around web applications so that they can run on the 
desktop. It gives you a modern HTML5 / CSS / JS frontend for your user interface, but then allows full backend 
functionality written in popular server scripting languages that anyone can pick up like node or php 
(more choices coming soon). This makes it possible to read and write directly to disk, 
access databases, communicate with servers and solve the task at hand.

Try it out now with the following download:
+ [Windows](http://deskshell.org?download=WindowsInstall)
+ [MacOS](http://deskshell.org?download=MacInstall)
+ Linux coming soon.
