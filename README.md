appjs-deskshell
===============

SDK for building desktop applications using html5 / css / js. A simple json file with a .desk extension launches
a desktop app with a frontend built using web technologies. The application can communicate with a backend
built using familiar server scripts like nodejs or php. This backend allows you to access databases,
write to disk and do whatever you need outside of the browser sandbox.


Windows:
========

The quickest way to start using deskshell for windows is to download the installer. This includes an example app
that also serves as documentation and guide for the project. http://appjs.delightfulsoftware.com/deskshell/.


Mac:
====
Take a look at bin/mac folder. We will release an installer in the future.

Linux:
============

Take a look at bin/linux folder. We will release an installer in the future.



See http://appjs.delightfulsoftware.com/ for my previous work on packaging appjs for windows and linux.
